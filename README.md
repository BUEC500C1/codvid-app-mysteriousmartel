# COVID-19 Cross-Platform App

The original prompt of this app was to build a REACT cross-platform app that intergrates Google maps with a COVID-19 API. Because I struggled to integrate the maps part, I instead made a cross-platform chatbot in REACT that allows you to ask for information on the disease.

In this repo are the original Hello World app in REACT, and the app.js file for the chatbot.

## Components

- REACT Native
- Dialogflow

## How it works

Testing of the app can be done in <a href="https://console.actions.google.com">Google Actions Console</a>. Head to the test tab and run the simulation. Sample questions can be such as:

- Where can I get testing?
- Is the virus airborne?

The Android version of the app looks as follows:
